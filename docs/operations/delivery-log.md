# Autonomous delivery log

This is the audit trail for changes delivered through the bulk autonomous lane in `AGENTS.md`. Each entry records the commit, validation evidence, scope, and residual risk so routine bulk work can proceed without turning the user into a PR messenger.

## 2026-09-09 — policy established

- Commit: `docs: enable bulk autonomous delivery lane` (this commit)
- Scope: establishes the bulk autonomous delivery lane and this log.
- Verification: documentation-only; `git diff --check`.
- Residual risk: the lane is intentionally narrow. Anything that changes production data, security, infrastructure, cost, contracts, or architecture remains outside it.

## 2026-09-09 — Wave 1 seed evidence preflight

- Commit: `feat: prepare bulk Wave 1 seed evidence preflight` (this commit)
- Scope: adds a non-mutating preflight generator and a 67-row candidate fixture derived from captured first-party homepage metadata.
- Verification: Ruff, Ruff formatting, mypy strict, 5 targeted tests, strict seed-fixture evidence validation, and `git diff --check`.
- Residual risk: homepage metadata is only an initial source signal. The fixture is not imported; a bulk Neon seed operation still needs explicit user approval.
